## Optimization Goals

### The objectives of model optimization were to: <br> 
Assess optimization capabilities: Ensure the transformer model can run efficiently on a local machine and optionally on a virtual environment like Google Colab.<br> 
Improve model efficiency: Identify steps to enhance performance and scalability.<br> 

### Further Optimization Steps to Consider
1) Expand dataset: Initially ran a subset of the dataset for feasibility; next step is to incorporate the full dataset. <br> 
2) Enhance data preprocessing <br> 
Further clean the dataset. <br> 
Add a column indicating whether Amazon flagged the data as spam. <br> 
3) Refine model implementation: Optimize both the transformer and optimization models to run seamlessly on local and virtual machines.
