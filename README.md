# AI_BOOTCAMP_Group_Project_3_Amazon
Took part in the cleaning and preprocessing and model training for the project. 

Primary focus initially was to ensure that the data was cleaned and had the proper columns and information needed.

Following this, went into the processing in order to prepare machine learning. This involved the removal of stopwords and applying a tokenizer. 

Lastly, then proceeded to test different models, between logistics, randomforest, and xgboost, all with their own strengths. 
    Logistic being the baseline tester, randomforest due to it's ability to use decisiontrees, and lastly xgboost because of its abilities
    to detect patterns especially across sentiment mapping.
