## Optimization Goals

The objectives of model optimization were to:
Assess optimization capabilities: Ensure the transformer model can run efficiently on a local machine and optionally on a virtual environment like Google Colab.
Improve model efficiency: Identify steps to enhance performance and scalability.
Further Optimization Steps to Consider
Expand dataset: Initially ran a subset of the dataset for feasibility; next step is to incorporate the full dataset.
Enhance data preprocessing:
Further clean the dataset.
Add a column indicating whether Amazon flagged the data as spam.
Refine model implementation: Optimize both the transformer and optimization models to run seamlessly on local and virtual machines.
